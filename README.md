Go Console-Based Program

This go application allows you to simulate a game of go fish with an AI player. 
There is only one file that contains all the functions for a game of go fish. There is also a main function in the file that creates and runs the game.
The game displays the AI and player hands/scores and the remaining cards. The game starts with the players turn and has validation for the rank input. After the player's turn 
then it is the AI's turn which randomly selects a rank value within the range of ranks. The game ends if a player runs out of cards or the deck is empty, at the 
end a winner or tie is displayed.
